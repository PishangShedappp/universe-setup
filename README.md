# Universe Setup

**Universe Setup** is a powerful CLI tool designed to help developers quickly start projects with pre-configured templates and integrated technologies. It provides a range of ready-to-use templates that make bootstrapping a new project faster and easier.

## Getting Started

```bash
npx universe-setup@latest

You will be prompted with the following questions to configure your project:
```bash
? Please enter the name of your project: (my-project)
? Which framework do you want to use? (Use arrow keys)
? Which UI library do you want to use? (Use arrow keys)
? Do you want to auto-install dependencies? (y/N)
```

## Optional:

#### Vite
If you choose Vite as your framework, you'll be asked an additional question:
```bash
? Which Vite framework do you want to use? (Use arrow keys)
```
